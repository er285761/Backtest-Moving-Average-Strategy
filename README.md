# Backtest-Moving-Average-Strategy
This Streamlit application allows users to backtest a Moving Average Crossover strategy on historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. Users input a stock ticker symbol, a start date, initial capital, and the window sizes for short-term and long-term moving averages. The application calculates these moving averages to determine trading positions and computes strategy returns while factoring in transaction costs and slippage. It displays the historical stock prices, volume trends, buy/sell signals, and key performance metrics such as cumulative returns, win/loss ratio, and profit factor. By visualizing the backtest results and trading metrics, the application provides a detailed analysis of how the moving average crossover strategy would have performed historically.

The Streamlit application provides an interactive platform for analyzing stocks through various dashboards. Users can choose between 'Fundamental Analysis', 'News', 'Stock Predictions, 'Wikipedia', and 'Reddit' dashboards from the sidebar. Each dashboard is tailored to offer specific insights and data related to a selected stock, enhancing the user's ability to make informed investment decisions. The 'Fundamental Analysis' dashboard gathers comprehensive financial data using the Yahoo Finance API, presenting detailed company information, balance sheets, cash flows, and key financial metrics.

The 'News' dashboard integrates with the News API to fetch and display the latest news articles about the selected stock. This section supplements the financial data with current events and media coverage, helping users understand the market sentiment and potential impacts on stock performance. Basic stock information, such as industry, sector, and market capitalization, is also displayed to provide context for the news articles.

The 'Stock Predictions' dashboard leverages historical stock price data and a pre-trained machine learning model to forecast future stock prices. It includes visualizations of historical prices, moving averages, and volume trends. Additionally, the dashboard evaluates prediction performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 Score. Users can also view the model's predicted stock price for the next day, offering a data-driven approach to anticipate stock movements.

Lastly, the 'Wikipedia' dashboard retrieves and displays Wikipedia content related to the selected stock, providing a comprehensive company background. Basic stock information is also shown to give users a quick overview of the company's sector and market presence. While the 'Reddit' dashboard is currently a placeholder, it is intended to aggregate and display discussions from Reddit, offering insights into public sentiment and community discussions about the stock. This multi-faceted approach ensures that users have access to diverse sources of information, combining historical data, current news, expert predictions, and community insights to make well-rounded investment decisions.
